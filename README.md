# Invisible Frames
This very tiny and lightweight datapack allows players to toggle their item frame's visibility. Minecraft 1.16 - Latest Snapshot (20w12a)

## Usage:
It only takes one step to change the frame's visibility: Just place a normal glass block into the item frame and it will turn invisible in absolutely no time! If you want to make it visible again, just place the glass item into the frame as before.

You can also decide whether the glass item should get deleted after use, or if it should get dropped again to be picked up afterwards. Just use `/trigger consume_glass` and you will see in which mode the system changed (the text above your hotbar).

## Note:
This datapack should work alright in Multiplayer, tho it didn't get tested yet. (It consists of only a few commands, what should go wrong there? :P)

## Installation:
This Datapack does not need any user interaction to get the program working, just place the file into the datapacks folder of your world.
